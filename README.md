My Puzzle App is designed for users who want to generate and solve number-word puzzles. It is built with React, Material-UI, and Chart.js, providing a clean and modern interface for puzzle enthusiasts. The app is split into two main sections: Puzzle Generator and Puzzle Solver, allowing users to seamlessly generate random puzzles and solve them.

Functionality
Puzzle Generator Page:

The user can input the desired number of words to generate a random word puzzle string.
After clicking the Generate button, a loading symbol is displayed for 2.5 seconds.
Once the string is generated, a modal appears, prompting the user to either solve the generated puzzle or perform other actions.
If the user chooses to solve the puzzle, they are redirected to the Puzzle Solver page, where the generated string is automatically populated into the input field.
Error handling is in place to provide meaningful messages, such as warnings for empty inputs or network issues.
Puzzle Solver Page:

The user can input a string manually or use a generated string to solve the puzzle.
After clicking the Solve button, the app counts occurrences of words in the input string and displays the results in a bar chart.
A total word count is provided alongside the chart for a clearer overview.
The app includes robust error handling for empty inputs and network connection issues.
Additional Features
Responsive Design: The app is optimized for mobile and tablet devices.
Dialogs: Interactive modals guide users through the process of generating and solving puzzles, enhancing the user experience.
Chart Visualization: The Puzzle Solver page visualizes the word counts using a bar chart, making it easier for users to understand the distribution of words.
